## Instructions for automatically deploying the logic Apps flow ##

*The deployment script can be run from your local machine, by first cloning (downloading) the repository to your local machine. Or you can run the script using Azure cloud shell.
The script uses Azure CLI, if you run the script from your local machine install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) first*

1. Clone the repository to [Azure cloud shell](https://shell.azure.com) or to your local machine
2. Navigate to the `Receive Defender Software update report` folder
3. Run `.\deploy.ps1` - this script
    * will ask you to provide
        * the name of the Resource group
        * an Azure region (In case you don't know which regions are available, please run `az account list-locations -o table`)

        where you want your resources to be deployed
    * will deploy
        * the resource group (if not already existing)
        * the Logic App
        * the user-assigned Managed Identity

Lastly, the required permissions of WindowsDefenderATP and Microsoft Graph API will be assigned to the Managed Identity

Now let's make the flow work:

1. Log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Select the resource group that you created by running the script
3. Navigate to the Logic App
. Browse to Api connections, select **Edit connections**
4. Select **Authorize**
5. Select **Sign in**
6. Select **Save**
7. Add the Email Address in the Logic App to meet your needs.

*It takes a while before the Graph permissions are active, the first run of the flow might fail*
